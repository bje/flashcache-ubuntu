flashcache for Ubuntu
=====================

This is a packaged version of the facebook flashcache modules
and tools for use on Ubuntu systems.

This is EXPERIMENTAL packaging for EXPERIMENTAL software.  It is
entirely possible that use of this packaging or software will ruin
your system.  Please do not proceed if you are not willing to fix
broken systems yourself.

The software that is packaged here is licensed under the GPLv2.  Please see
README for more details.

The ORIGINAL repository for flashcache lies at 
https://github.com/facebook/flashcache -- please refer to that repository
if you want to run flashcache on other systems, not this one.

Please submit pull requests if you have packaging improvements.

I will try to keep this in step with upstream, but my priority is that
these packages work correctly on our internal infrastructure.

If you already have a working flashcache system, I highly recommend
that you avoid these packages and just stick with what you're already
doing.

Usage
-----

 1. read all the flashcache documentation.

 1. Clone repo.
